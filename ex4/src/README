= answering to the questions =
==============================

1. The class "HashString" (which i built aditionaly) purpose is to add flag to any string value, who saves parameter with the relevant state : deleted,new or occupied.
I built this class in order to enable knowing (when using openHasSet) whether the cell in the table is totally empty, or was full by value that was deleted 
or is occupied by a certain value.  

2. I chose to implement ChainedHashTable in the way who was reccomanded by the school. Which means i used an ArrayList<LinkedList<String>> instead of a standard array
i found this way the most comfortable , reasonable and effective way.

3. I implemented  the deletion mechanism in OpenHasSet in the following way: i wrapped any string who should be hashed to the table in object called HashString
and that object has a private field called State who keep the state of the cell (NEW, DELETED or OCCUPIED) and in that way i know the "history" of the cell in case i want to operate things on the
table such as delete value, add value or checking whether the table contains certain value.
